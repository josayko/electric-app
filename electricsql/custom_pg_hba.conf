# Example: To require client certificate authentication (verify-full)
# for a specific user/database, you would add lines like these:
# hostssl   my_database     my_user         0.0.0.0/0               cert clientcert=verify-full

# DO NOT put any 'host' entries here if you want to strictly enforce SSL,
# as 'host' allows both SSL and non-SSL connections.
